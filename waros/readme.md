# WARoS - The Web Assemply Robot System

An homage to Crobots, a C-driven API that allows creation and combat of virtual bots.

This is the Final project of [Programming Web Assembly with Rust](https://pragprog.com/book/khrust/programming-webassembly-with-rust)

Note that creating a workspace in the root folder (`waros`) will cause all builds to be put into a target directory in root and allow for tests across all subjects to be run from the root directory.
